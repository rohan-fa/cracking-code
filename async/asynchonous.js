// in the jsEngineWebAPI how operations are executing lets explore that 

//first => js code executes => creates a call stack => inside call stack there's global execution context creates => and ony by one function gets loaded. 

// registered callback stores all the events orders


//task queue: normal queue comes first goes first, 

// fetchAPI => fetch api also works on task queue, it expand the task queue, maybe second task queue which in higher priority, inside fetch there's a promise concept comes. that means please
// promise me you will do that work after that work, or if that a success tell me or not success also tell me that


// setTimeout() => it is a method, and also calls API, Timeout() we get it as a number

//handler => is a callback and its a function without name. 

//setInterval => it takes a break and after that it runs on and on. setTimeout does not do work again and again
